## Quality Gate Status widget 

You can monitor the Quality Gate status of your projects directly in your Azure DevOps dashboard. Follow these simple steps to configure your widget:

1. Once the Azure DevOps extension is installed and your project has been successfully analyzed, go to one of your Azure DevOps dashboards (or create one). Click on the pen icon in the bottom right corner of the screen, and then on the "+" icon to add a widget. 

2. In the list of widgets, select the "Code Quality" one and then click on the "Add" button. An empty widget is added to your dashboard. 

3. You can then click on the widget's cogwheel icon to configure it.

    * **For public projects:** you can simply select your project from the dropdown. A searchbar inside the dropdown will help you find it easily. Just select it and click on the "Save" button.

    * **For private projects:** you'll have to log in using the links provided under the dropdown. Once logged in, your private projects will appear in the dropdown. Select the one you are interested in, and click on "Save".
