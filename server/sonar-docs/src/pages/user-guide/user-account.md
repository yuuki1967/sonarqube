As a {instance} user you have your own space where you can see the things that are relevant to you:

## Home Page

It gives you a summary of:

* your Groups
* your SCM accounts

## Security

If <!-- sonarqube -->your instance is<!-- /sonarqube --> <!-- sonarcloud -->you are<!-- /sonarcloud --> not using a 3rd party authentication mechanism such as <!-- sonarqube -->LDAP or<!-- /sonarqube --> an OAuth provider (GitHub, Google Account, ...), you can change your password from here. Additionally, you can also manage your own authentication tokens.

You can create as many Tokens as you want. Once a Token is created, you can use it to perform analysis on a project where you have the [Execute Analysis](/instance-administration/security/) permission.
