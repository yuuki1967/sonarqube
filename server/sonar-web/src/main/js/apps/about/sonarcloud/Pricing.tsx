            <div className="faq-title">What payment options are available ?</div>
            <p>
              Payment is done online by credit card and will happen automatically every month, based
              on the plan you choose. We also accept to receive a purchase order and a wire transfer
              payment, if ordering a yearly subscription for more than 1M LOCs. In this case, you
              need to contact us through the Contact form.
            </p>
            <div className="faq-title">Can I try a private project on SonarCloud for free?</div>
            <p>
              Your first 14 days are on us. You just have to upgrade your organization to a paid
              plan, and fill your credit card information to get started. After your trial, if you
              love it you can continue using SonarCloud and you will be charged for the plan you
              selected when you first started your free trial. You can cancel anytime.

          <div>
            <div className="faq-title">What is a Line of Code (LOC) on SonarCloud?</div>
            <p>
              LOCs are computed by summing up the LOCs of each project analyzed in SonarCloud. The
              LOCs used for a project are the LOCs found during the most recent analysis of this
              project.
            </p>
            <div className="faq-title">How are Lines of Code (LOCs) counted towards billing?</div>
            <p>
              Only LOC from your private projects are counted toward your maximum number of LOCs. If
              your project contains branches, the counted LOCs are the ones of the biggest branch.
              The count is not related to how frequently the source code is analyzed. If your
              private project has a 6K LOCs and you analyze it 100 times in the month, this will be
              counted as 6K for the billing. If you are getting close to the threshold you will be
              notified to either upgrade your plan or reduce the number of LOCs in your projects.
            </p>
            <div className="faq-title">When will I be invoiced?</div>
            <p>
              You will be invoiced once a month, the day of the month after your trial ends. For
              example if you start your free trial on January 1st, it will last till January 14th
              and you will be first billed on January 15th for your upcoming month, e.g. January
              15th to February 15th.
            </p>
            <div className="faq-title">Can I cancel my subscription?</div>
            <p>
              Of course! There&apos;s no commitment. You can delete your paid organization whenever
              you wish, or simply downgrade to the free tier if you wish to keep on analysing some
              public projects.
            </p>
