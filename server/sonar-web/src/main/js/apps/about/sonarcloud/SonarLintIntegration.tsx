                SonarLint will provide developers with instant feedback in their IDEs as they are
                writing code, like with a spell checker. SonarLint also shows already existing
                issues in the code and enables developers to differentiate what issues they
                introduced.

                not only everyone in the team uses the same rules but it also means that if you
                update this ruleset, everybody will use immediately the updated one.
