SonarQube [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/SonarSource/sonarqube.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/SonarSource/sonarqube)
=========

Continuous Inspection
---------------------
SonarQube provides the capability to not only show health of an application but also to highlight issues newly introduced. With a Quality Gate in place, you can [fix the leak](https://blog.sonarsource.com/water-leak-changes-the-game-for-technical-debt-management) and therefore improve code quality systematically.

Have Question or Feedback?
--------------------------

For support questions ("How do I?", "I got this error, why?", ...), please first read the [documentation](https://docs.sonarqube.org) and then head to the [SonarSource forum](https://community.sonarsource.com/). There are chances that a question similar to yours has already been answered. 

Be aware that this forum is a community, so the standard pleasantries ("Hi", "Thanks", ...) are expected. And if you don't get an answer to your thread, you should sit on your hands for at least three days before bumping it. Operators are not standing by. :-)


Contributing
------------

### Pull Request

Please create a new thread in the forum ["Suggest new features"](https://community.sonarsource.com/c/suggestions/features) when contributing a new feature. You have to be sure that the feature complies with our roadmap and expectations. 

To submit a code contribution, create a pull request for this repository. Please explain your motives to contribute this change (if it's not a new feature): what problem you are trying to fix, what improvement you are trying to make.

Make sure that you follow our [code style](https://github.com/SonarSource/sonar-developer-toolset#code-style) and all [tests](#testing) are passing (Travis build is executed for each pull request).


Building
--------

To build sources locally follow these instructions.

### Build and Run Unit Tests

Execute from project base directory:

    ./gradlew build

The zip distribution file is generated in `sonar-application/build/distributions/`. Unzip it and start server by executing:

    # on linux
    bin/linux-x86-64/sonar.sh start 
    # or on MacOS
    bin/macosx-universal-64/sonar.sh start
    # or on Windows
    bin\windows-x86-64\StartSonar.bat 

### Open in IDE

If the project has never been built, then build it as usual (see previous section) or use the quicker command:

    ./gradlew ide
    
Then simply open the root file `build.gradle` as a project in Intellij or Eclipse.

### Find available updates of dependencies

Execute from project base directory:

    ./gradlew dependencyUpdates

### Update the files missing the license header

Execute from project base directory:

    ./gradlew licenseFormat --rerun-tasks
    
### List all dependencies

Execute from project base directory:

    ./gradlew printDependencies
